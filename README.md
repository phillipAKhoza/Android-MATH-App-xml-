# MATH APP
## The aim of this app was to build an android app using xml instead of jetpack compose.
the aim of this app is to expand my knowledge if android dev focusing mainly on building UI using xml

### This is a math app ideal for kids <14yrs
the app has three sections/sub-game: Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication.
* Each question on the respective section/sub-game is timed to 40 seconds and the player will be penalised if they do not answer within the given time.
* The timer is paused once an answer is provided(correct or incorrect)
* A player only has 3 lives per game and it is redused if the time expires or an incorrect answer is given
* Once all the lives are depleted the player is taken to a result page where they see their total score, the the player can either exit or try again
